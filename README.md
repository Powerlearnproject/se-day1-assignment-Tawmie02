Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline that uses well defined engineering concepts required to produce efficient,durable,scalable,in-budget and one-time software products.
Importance of Software Engineering 
1.In businesses,it helps organizations and companies to optimise their operations
2.Has led to the design of sustainable solutions for urban development.
3.In the health sector,health care systems developed using software enginering principles ensure accuracy and privacy.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Early computing-software was written in machine language.
2.High level languages era-
3.Modern software engineering-use of AI,machine learning and blockchain
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-involves defining the project scope,objectives,and feasibility
2.Analysis-involves gathering requirements,analyzing them and specifying them in a document.
3 Design-involves creating the system architechture both hardware and software and the network 
4.Implementation-involves converting the design into a functioning system.
5.Testing-involves checking if the system works as expected and fixing any bugs that may be present.
6.Deployment-involves releasing the software to production.
7.Maintenance
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison between waterfall and Agile methodologies
1.Both are ued for softwae development with the goal of deliverign a functional and high quality product
2.Both involve testing and deployment
Differences
1.waterfall is a rigid model while agile is highly flexible
2.waterfall follows distinct phases while agile uses cycles
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Roles of a software developer 
1.Improving system quality by debugging and fixing software issues 
2.Writing clean,efficient code
3.Maintaining and improving existing codebases
Roles of a quality assurance engineer
1.design test plans,test cases and test scripts
2.ensure the software meets performance,security and usability features
3.Implements continuous testing in devops
Roles of a project manager 
1.planning and scheduling
2.managing the team
3.budget and resource management
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDE and VCS
an IDE provides an environment for software development while a VCS tracks changes insource code.This enhance productivity and collaboration among team members.
Example of a IDE is visual studio code
Example of a VCS is git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges in software engineering
1.managing project complexity
2.Evolving technologies
3.Changing user requirements
Strategies in overcoming challenges
1.Collaboration and communication in the team
2.Continuous learning and adopting agile methodologies
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
       1. Unit Testing- Tests individual components (functions, methods, or modules) in isolation.
       2.System Testing- Tests the complete system as a whole.
       3. Acceptance Testing -Validates whether the software meets user and business requirements beforeÂ deployment.
       4.Integration Testing- Tests the interaction between multiple modules or components.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering referws to the process of designing and refinig inputs to guide AImodels to generate accurate,relevant and high-quality responses.
importance of prompt engineering
1.enhance response quality
2.easily optimize AI for different applications
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt-"tell me about history"
correct prompt-"give me a detailed summary of the events that took place in world war 1".
